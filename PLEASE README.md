# Rino-Programming-Language-v-1.0

This is my first custom programming language that can be a bit... weird at times.
Also it gets really angry if you mess up.

I won't make a file for the grammer rules, you'll just have to figure out how this language works.
Keywords (because I'm not that mean):
fn: = new function (easy)
var: = new var (you should know this)
